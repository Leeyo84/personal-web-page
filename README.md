Personal Web Page Portfolio. Will show skill-sets for Leeyo84 to potential employers to visit. 

## Milestone 1 Feedback
* Nice job on your goal, audience, and purpose.  Clear and straightforward.
* Ideally, you should have a picture with your persona.
* Your website passes the validator cleanly.  Well done.
* Your git commits are generally good, though you should commit a little bit more frequently.

Overall, this is a very good project.  No picture or styling keeps this from being a truly exceptional project, but you're solid in every respect.

**Overall grade: Tier III**

## Milestone 2 Feedback.
* Website passes validation cleanly.  Well done.
* These wireframes show a very clear aesthetic for your site.  This will be a distinct look that will very much separate you from other candidates.  I've seen very low-key background images work very well with sparse layouts like these.  You may want to consider adding one if you haven't already.
* With the vertical line layout, make sure you test it thoroughly on many different sizes to make sure it doesn't overlap with your text and accidentally make it unreadable.  Or even better, use a semi-transparent background div around your text and make sure that the lines will visually appear behind it if they occupy the same space.

Overall, the visual look of these wireframes establishes a coherent, eye-catching visual look for the site.  This look is ambitious and may be difficult to achieve, but if you can pull it off, this will be a great PWP.  Nice work.  

**This milestone grades out at a Tier IV**

## Milestone 4 feedback
Looks good. Design follows your intended content strategy. Consistent git commits/pushes. There are no major issues with rendering on mobile/browser. This passes at a Tier IV.
