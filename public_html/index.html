	<div>
		<p>I am a Fullstack Web Developer based out of Albuquerque New Mexico with a passion for learning and creating visually enticing projects.
			<br> I studied Fine Arts for two years at Central New Mexico Community College and over two years at the University of New Mexico.

			<br>I take pride in my work and want to be a positive influence on my community. I strive to be a resource for Hispanic women,
